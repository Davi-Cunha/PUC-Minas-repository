                        <p>I started Computer Engineering course at FUMEC, which is more focused on hardware at 2016 but
                            I changed to Computer Science because I got more interested on software development than
                            hardware development over time. Another factor that made me decide to move to Computer
                            Science is due fact that I started a company and we needed a computer scientist as CTO
                            (me).</p>
